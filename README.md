## Malaria and Ebola Analysis with Hawkes Processes

This repository contains a project that focuses on the analysis of the evolution and dynamics of malaria and Ebola using Hawkes Processes. Hawkes Processes are powerful tools for modeling and understanding the temporal dependencies and self-exciting nature of events in various domains.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to explore and analyze the temporal patterns and interdependencies of malaria and Ebola cases using Hawkes Processes. The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and quality. This step may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

2. Hawkes Process Modeling: Apply the Hawkes Process framework to model the temporal dynamics of malaria and Ebola cases. This includes estimating the parameters of the Hawkes Process, such as the baseline intensity and triggering kernel, which capture the self-exciting nature of the events.

3. Visualization and Analysis: Visualize the results of the Hawkes Process modeling to gain insights into the patterns and interdependencies of malaria and Ebola cases over time. This may include generating plots, heatmaps, and other visual representations to highlight key findings.

4. Interpretation and Evaluation: Interpret the results of the analysis in the context of malaria and Ebola dynamics. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Hawkes Process modeling approach and discuss the implications of the findings for understanding and managing these diseases.
